# Hospital Database Management System

## Project Overview

The **Hospital Database Management System** was developed as a semester-long project by a team of four students, including myself, for Lake Ridge Community Hospital (LRCH). This project aimed to address critical challenges in patient data management, financial tracking, and operational efficiency by implementing a scalable, secure, and reliable database system.

The project showcases proficiency in database design, SQL programming, and application of healthcare IT standards. It effectively integrates various hospital operations, offering a robust foundation for future scalability and adaptability.

## Project Goals and Scope

### Objective
To transform LRCHâ€™s legacy information system into a modern, relational database system that improves patient care, enhances financial transparency, and supports strategic decision-making.

### Functional Scope
1. **Patient Management**: Enable clerks to search, update, and archive patient records efficiently.
2. **Billing and Financial Tracking**: Streamline billing processes and generate accurate financial reports.
3. **Treatment Tracking**: Manage detailed treatment records, prescriptions, and associated costs.
4. **Operational Insights**: Generate reports on room utilization, physician-patient interactions, and daily revenue.

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design
The database was designed using a **3NF normalized relational schema**, ensuring data integrity and efficient query performance. Key tables include:
- **Patients**: Tracks personal and contact information.
- **Admissions**: Records patient admissions and bed allocations.
- **Transactions**: Logs billing details with cost centers.
- **Treatments**: Captures treatment and prescription data.

### Views and Stored Procedures
- **Custom Views**:
  - `Daily_Revenue_Report`: Summarizes charges by patient and date.
  - `Room_Utilization_Report`: Displays room and bed occupancy data.
- **Stored Procedures**:
  - `CalculateTotalCharges`: Computes total charges for a patient.
  - `GetCurrentPatients`: Retrieves active patients by physician and bed.
  - `GetPatientAppointments`: Lists appointments for a patient.

### Reporting and Analysis
Reports such as **Physician-Patient Relationships**, **Billing Summaries**, and **Financial Analysis by Cost Center** were designed to support hospital operations and compliance requirements.

## Development Process

### Team Collaboration
This project was completed in a team of four, where I contributed significantly to database schema design, implementation of stored procedures, and report generation. We adhered to Agile principles, holding weekly sprints to ensure steady progress.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Complex Relationships**:
  Managed intricate relationships (e.g., multi-key primary relationships in admissions) using carefully designed ER diagrams and constraints.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  Employed indexing, optimized queries, and connection pooling to ensure fast data retrieval for large datasets.
- **Data Integrity**:
  Enforced constraints and triggers to maintain consistency across tables.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Validated individual stored procedures and views.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensured seamless interaction between entities.
- **Performance Testing**: Optimized query execution times for reports.

## Results and Achievements

### Business Impact
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced data retrieval times for patient records and financial summaries.
- **Scalability**: Designed a system capable of supporting LRCHâ€™s expansion plans.
- **Compliance**: Ensured adherence to healthcare regulations for data management and security.

### Metrics
- **Database Size**: ~25 relational tables with normalized structures.
- **Performance**: Average query execution time <200ms for large datasets.
- **Data Accuracy**: Achieved 100% accuracy in financial reports during testing.
